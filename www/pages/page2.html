<!--my original goal for the second page was to have the "completed" dares from the home page stored so that it could look almost as a trophy wall. I wasn't able to figure out how to get it to appear, but when I linked to /page 2/ from my completed button it did dissapear from the home page. I'll probably look more into local and session storage during the break :) cause I was really interested in learning how to transfer data between html pages without having a strong background in databases and stuff. -->
